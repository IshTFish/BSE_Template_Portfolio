# Twitter Bot Project
In this project, I worked on creating a bot on Raspberry Pi that could send out tweets.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was setting up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my chip. In doing this, I hooked up the monitor, keyboard, and mouse to my chip and connected the chip itself to power so that the computer could function. After that, I booted up the computer so that I could confirm that every component worked as should be. While I would face several challenges later on in this project, completing this milestone was relatively simple for the most part as connecting each component to the raspberry pi chip was fairly straightforward
