# Twitter Bot Project
In this project, I worked on creating a bot on Raspberry Pi that could send out tweets.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone (Sending out First Tweet)
My second milestone involved sending out my first tweet on my twitter account through a bot that I had created on Twitter, Ish6. To be able to do this, I had to first set up the bot on twitter by creating a new application on twitter's developers website which would give me all the resources that I would need later on for coding. After doing this, I began to use the Raspberry Pi for the first time in order to code the bot to send tweets. During this step, I faced several challenges since the code for making a twitter bot was flawed in many cases after searching on the internet. Fortunately though, after enough searching and troubleshooting, I was able to find code that both made sense and worked the way I wanted it to. The video below shows the code I used and demonstrates the process that I go through to send out tweets using the bot.

# First Milestone (Setting up Raspberry Pi)
My first milestone was setting up the Raspberry Pi and all the necessary components onto my chip. In doing this, I hooked up the monitor, keyboard, and mouse to my chip and connected the chip itself to power so that the computer could function. After that, I booted up the computer so that I could confirm that every component worked as should be. While I would face several challenges later on in this project, completing this milestone was relatively simple for the most part as connecting each component to the raspberry pi chip was fairly straightforward
